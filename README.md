Welcome to the very first repo which contains my first coding work in this Computer Programming diploma course.

After looking backwards as a Teaching Assistant helping students in the course, I found out there are a lof of places I could make improvements on.

If you are a fellow or a recruiter, thanks for dropping by! Please bear with my ugly codes in my early start.

If you are a student which is Googling or searching on GitHub for source code, I would strongly suggest you to learn but not copy from my codes, because there are a lot of bad coding practise or even hard coding at some points. However, learn from both the corrects and mistakes set the milestones of our coding journey.

Do NOT simply copy my code as yours, although I know a lot of people do because it happened to my classmates and my students as well, this is completely a waste of time to study this course because you will NOT be able to code when you get to work. If you are studying this CS course only because your fellows says this gets your higher points for immigration, you are probably in a trap because you will find it hundred times more difficult when you get to the next and the next semester, which I don't want to see people wasting money and drop the courses. And you know, starting from this year chatGPT arrives and no one knows how to code, at the same time employers don't need that much of people to code which is an interesting phenomenon :-P

At the end, no matter you copy codes from github or just simply use AI, make sure you understand what the codes are doing. You are always welcome to comment/ drop me a message if you want to talk about the codes.

Happy coding!
