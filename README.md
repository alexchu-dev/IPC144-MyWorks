Welcome to the very first repo which contains my first coding work in this Computer Programming diploma course.

After looking backwards as a Teaching Assistant helping students in the course, I found out there are a lof of places I could make improvements on.

If you are a student which is Googling or searching on GitHub for source code, I would strongly suggest you to learn but not copy from my codes, because there are a lot of bad coding practise or even hard coding at some points. However, learn from both the corrects and mistakes set the milestones of our coding journey.

Do NOT simply copy my codes as yours, my codes aren't great, and this is completely a waste of time to study this course because you will NOT be able to code when you get to work. Try to understand the notion behind the codes.

Happy coding!
